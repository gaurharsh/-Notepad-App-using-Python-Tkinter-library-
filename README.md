## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  npm install my-project
  cd my-project
```
    
## To create a notepad app, you would need to use Python to build the GUI using the Tkinter library. You would also need to use Python's built-in open and write functions to read and write to the text files that the app creates.

Some potential challenges you may face while building a notepad app include:

Figuring out how to use the Tkinter library to create the app's GUI. This may involve learning about Tkinter widgets and layout managers, as well as how to use them to create the desired interface.

Working with text files and using the open and write functions to read and write to them. You may need to understand how these functions work and how to use them to manipulate the text files.

Debugging the app and fixing any issues that arise. This may involve using debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix problems with the app's code.

To overcome these challenges, you may want to seek out resources such as tutorials, documentation, and online communities where you can ask questions and get help. Practicing coding and working on similar projects can also help you build your skills and become more comfortable with the technologies involved.

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
